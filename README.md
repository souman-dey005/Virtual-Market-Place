# NFT Marketplace DApp

## Project Vision

To create a decentralized, trustless, and user-friendly NFT marketplace that empowers creators and collectors to trade digital assets directly without intermediaries, while ensuring fair pricing, transparent transactions, and low fees.

## Project Description

The NFT Marketplace DApp is a comprehensive decentralized application built on Ethereum that facilitates the buying and selling of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The platform provides a secure, transparent, and efficient environment for users to list their NFTs, discover new collections, and execute trades directly on the blockchain.
